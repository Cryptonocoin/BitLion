What is BitLIon Coin?
------------------------

BitLIonCoin is a lite version of Litecoin using scrypt-jane with adaptive N-factor as a proof-of-work algorithm.

Specs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Block target time:**
 - 20 seconds before 1000th block
 - 2 minutes after 1000th block

**Confirmations:**
 - 6 Confirmations per transaction, 1000 confirmations for mined blocks

**Block rewards:**
 - Block 1- 200: 1 + 1d4
 - Block 200-50,000: 100 + 1d20 *(20 roll is critical hit: block reward doubles and miner gets another 100 bonus coins)*
 - Block 50,000-100,000: 50 + 1d16 *(+ 1/20 chance to get double rewards)*
 - Block 100,000-150,000: 30 + 1d8 *(+ 1/20 chance to get double rewards)*
 - Block 150,000-200,000: 20 + 1d6 *(+ 1/20 chance to get double rewards)*
 - Block 200,000+: 10 + 1d4 *(+ 1/20 chance to get double rewards)*
 - DGW2 as retargeting method *(difficulty recalculating for each new block)*
 - Premine: 1.5 % of 1 year mining period for coin development and support  

Random rewards delayed by one block.

The rest is the same as Litecoin.

Development process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the BlackDragonCoin
development team members simply pulls it.

If it is a *more complicated or potentially controversial* change, then the patch
submitter will be asked to start a discussion (if they haven't already) on the
[mailing list](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=bitcoin-development).

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.
Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't
match the project's coding conventions (see `doc/coding.txt`) or are
controversial.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of BlackDragonCoin.

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test. Please be patient and help out, and
remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code.

Unit tests for the core code are in `src/test/`. To compile and run them:

    cd src; make -f makefile.unix test

Unit tests for the GUI code are in `src/qt/test/`. To compile and run them:

    qmake BLC_QT_TEST=1 -o Makefile.test bitlioncoin-qt.pro
    make -f Makefile.test
    ./bitlionncoin-qt_test
